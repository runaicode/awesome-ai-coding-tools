# Contributing to Awesome AI Coding Tools

Thank you for helping make this list better! Here's how to contribute.

## Adding a New Tool

### Requirements

Before submitting, make sure the tool meets these criteria:

- **Actively maintained** — last update within the past 6 months
- **Publicly available** — has a website or public repository
- **AI-powered** — uses machine learning or LLMs as a core feature (not just a wrapper)
- **Developer-focused** — designed for software development workflows

### How to Submit

1. **Fork** this repository
2. **Edit** `README.md`
3. **Add your tool** in the correct category, maintaining alphabetical order
4. **Follow the format** below
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

### Entry Format

```markdown
| [Tool Name](https://tool-url.com) | One-line description of what the tool does — be specific and avoid marketing speak | Pricing |
```

**Pricing badges:**
- `Free` — completely free, no paid tier
- `Free (Open Source)` — open source and free to use
- `Free (Beta)` — free during beta period
- `Freemium` — free tier available with paid upgrades
- `Paid` — no free tier (trial periods don't count as free)

### Description Guidelines

- Start with what the tool **does**, not what it **is**
- Keep it to one line (under 120 characters is ideal)
- Avoid superlatives like "best", "revolutionary", "game-changing"
- Be specific: "generates unit tests with edge cases" > "AI testing tool"
- Use present tense: "generates" not "will generate"

### Good Examples

```markdown
| [Aider](https://aider.chat) | Terminal-based AI pair programmer — works with any LLM to edit code in your local git repo | Free (Open Source) |
| [CodeRabbit](https://coderabbit.ai) | AI-powered code review for GitHub/GitLab PRs — line-by-line feedback, security analysis, and auto-summaries | Freemium |
```

### Bad Examples

```markdown
| [CoolTool](https://example.com) | The best AI coding tool ever made | Free |
| [Another Tool](https://example.com) | AI tool for developers | Paid |
```

## Updating an Existing Entry

If a tool has changed (new pricing, rebranded, shut down), submit a PR with:

- The **old** entry
- The **new** entry (or a note about removal)
- A brief explanation of what changed

## Suggesting a New Category

If you think a category is missing:

1. Open an **issue** first to discuss it
2. Include at least 3 tools that would fit the category
3. Explain why existing categories don't cover them

## Removing a Tool

Tools should be removed if they are:

- **Defunct** — website is down, project archived
- **No longer AI-powered** — removed AI features
- **Acquired and shut down** — merged into another product

Submit a PR with an explanation and we'll review it.

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and constructive
- Don't submit tools you're affiliated with without disclosing it
- Don't remove competitors' tools
- Focus on developer utility, not marketing
